        <h3>Why does it look like this, though?</h3>
        <p>
          The modern web has very sleek and polished aesthetic, but also very
          standardized. There's a nostalgic place in my heart for the earlier
          web -- a place of weirdness, disorder and chaos. Traveling the web
          should feel like going on a new and exciting adventure, but a lot of
          the time it feels like the equivalent of traveling across the globe
          and visiting a Starbucks identical to the one near my house.
        </p>
        <h3>Was the older web better?</h3>
        <p>
          The web used to look like every person was given the same box of LEGOs
          and they arranged those shared blocks in different ways that
          communicated something about them. While it was a less polished
          experience, it was one that felt more human because much more of the
          design was visible to us. A lot of the web today feels like it came
          off an assembly line or was built by a corporate committee.
        </p>
        <h3>What's the point of this?</h3>
        <p>
          For me to have fun. The web is a delightful and magical place! Our
          websites should reflect our joys.
