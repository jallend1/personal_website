        <h3>Why does it look like this, though?</h3>
        <p>
          The internet used to be weird and chaotic -- and because of that it
          was also fun. The modern web is sleek and polished, but it's also very
          much the same. Traveling the web should feel like an adventure, not
          like leaving my hometown of Seattle to visit a Starbucks in Osaka.
        </p>
        <h3>What's the purpose of websites?</h3>
        <p>
          Visiting a website should offer a distinct experience. And we should
          maybe revisit the reasons why pages exist and not every page needs to
          be focused on keeping a visitor there as long as possible. This page
          exists because I want to have fun, and you are here because you want
          to know a bit more about me. Neither of those things should take a lot
          of time.
