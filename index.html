          The modern web has very sleek and polished aesthetic, but it's also
          very standardized. The earlier web felt weirder, disordered and more
          unpredictable. Visiting a new web page feels like going to a new
          Starbucks -- You know exactly what to expect.
        </p>
        <h3>Was the older web better?</h3>
        <p class="body-text">
          It struck me as more human. The web used to look like every person was
          given the same box of LEGOs and they arranged those shared blocks in
          different ways that communicated something about them. A lot of the
          web today feels like it came off an assembly line or was built by a
          corporate committee.
        </p>
        <h3>What's the point of this?</h3>
        <p class="body-text">
          Primarily for me to have fun. The web is a delightful and magical
          place! Our websites should reflect our joys.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          And an era where websites were just the Dancing Baby GIF from Ally
          McBeal and you didn't have to worry about whether your visit to the
          site was facilitating genocide in Myanmar or eroding democracy was
          simply a more joyous time to be online.
